Week 1
Group formed. But there are a series of issues during the team formation. One of our group members has a timetable clash, so we need to switch from the original lab session H18A to another lab session W16A. In addition, we have one more new group member joined. I created the WebCMS3 group and Jira project and invited group members and the mentor. We started to write the proposal. Together with Tianchen Yang, we wrote the user story and sprints section of the proposal. I also discussed with the team all technical details that we can use for the project. We also plan to explore the availability of different technologies. We plan to finish the technical section of the proposal next week once we finalize the technical stack.

Week 2
We finalized our backend technical stacks (Django + SQLite). We have meetings on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Our group continues working on the user stories and acceptance criteria. Previously our proposal is on Microsoft Office 365 Word, but the user experience is awful. We switch to Google Docs this week. Previously we split user stories based on web pages incorrectly. We add epic stories and reorder the user stories by epic stories. We also add story points, priority and difficulty to each user story. Together with Tianchen Yang, we drew the UML diagram. I and Tianchen plan to finish the system architecture graph next Monday. Our group plans to have a final review before next Wednesday Lab session.

Week 3
Together with Tianchen Yang, we drew the system architecture graph. We had a meeting to review the proposal on Tuesday. We identified several issues such as UML redundancy. Together with Tianchen Yang and Hanqing Guan, we updated the UML diagram. On Wednesday, the mentor reviewed our proposal and provided many valuable feedbacks. I updated the business layer part of the system architecture graph. I submitted the proposal on Thursday. Our group plans to start to code the project next week and have a meeting about API specifications.
