Week 1
Group formed. But there are a series of issues during the team formation. One of our group members has a timetable clash, so we need to switch from the original lab session H18A to another lab session W16A. In addition, we have one more new group member joined. I created the WebCMS3 group and Jira project and invited group members and the mentor. We started to write the proposal. Together with Tianchen Yang, we wrote the user story and sprints section of the proposal. I also discussed with the team all technical details that we can use for the project. We also plan to explore the availability of different technologies. We plan to finish the technical section of the proposal next week once we finalize the technical stack.

Week 2
We finalized our backend technical stacks (Django + SQLite). We have meetings on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Our group continues working on the user stories and acceptance criteria. Previously our proposal is on Microsoft Office 365 Word, but the user experience is awful. We switch to Google Docs this week. Previously we split user stories based on web pages incorrectly. We add epic stories and reorder the user stories by epic stories. We also add story points, priority and difficulty to each user story. Together with Tianchen Yang, we drew the UML diagram. I and Tianchen plan to finish the system architecture graph next Monday. Our group plans to have a final review before next Wednesday Lab session.

Week 3
Together with Tianchen Yang, we drew the system architecture graph. We had a meeting to review the proposal on Tuesday. We identified several issues such as UML redundancy. Together with Tianchen Yang and Hanqing Guan, we updated the UML diagram. On Wednesday, the mentor reviewed our proposal and provided many valuable feedbacks. I updated the business layer part of the system architecture graph. I submitted the proposal on Thursday. Our group plans to start to code the project next week and have a meeting about API specifications.

Week 4
Hanqing set up the Django framework and connected it to the SQLite3 database. Based on the Django framework, I finished user register/login/logout/change_password/forget_password and admin login/logout. In addition, I set up the Django framework URLs settings and encapsulated backend results in the HTTP response. On Saturday, we have a meeting about the connection between the backend and frontend. There was a setting that Cross-origin resource sharing was not enabled in Django and this issue took us about one hour to solve. On Saturday and Sunday, we are working on connecting the backend API to the frontend. But the work is still not finished, we expected it would be finished before the Progressive Demo A. Our group plans to finish Sprint 1 as soon as possible before the demo, conduct our retrospective meeting as soon as possible after the demo and start to work on Sprint 2.
